Course Description
Catalog Description:  This course is designed to equip you with the fundamental tools and techniques essential for solving complex computational problems. Throughout the course, we will explore a wide array of data structures—such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables—and learn how to effectively implement and use them in Python. We will also delve into essential algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimizing solutions to various problems. This course emphasizes not just learning the theory but applying it through hands-on coding exercises and problem-solving sessions that simulate real-world challenges. By the end of the course, you will be well-prepared to tackle advanced topics in data science, approach complex problems with confidence, and apply these skills in your professional or academic pursuits.

The topics covered in this course include the following, presented in the approximate order in which they will be taught.

- Computational Complexity
- Basic Data Structures and Algorithms
- Hash Tables
- Trees and Graphs
- Balanced Trees
- Advanced Algorithms I
- Advanced Algorithms II
- Classic CS Problems and Reductions
- Time Complexity Hierarchy
- Introduction to Databases
 

Course Title: DS5012-001 Foundation of Data Science (3 credits)

Instructors: Prof. Judy Fox

About the Instructor and TAs
We have one instructor and two TAs for this course. Their names and emails are shown in the table below. Each TA is responsible for a specific category (e.g., grading, office hours, labs, etc.). Students should always contact the relevant TA first, as the primary point of contact regarding issues in each category. Instructor responds to lectures and oversees the course, and TAs can more quickly address your concern on homework and grading or escalate the situation to an instructor if necessary.

Office Hours
Office hours (OH) are held in various locations throughout the week and are of varying type. Information can be found below. There are two possible locations for office hours:

In-Person: Some OH will be held in-person (in the Data Science Building). See the chart below for details. These will function as traditional office hours.

Online Zoom: Some OH will be held on Zoom. To attend office hours, simply join the Zoom office hours wait (it is called oh-up-next or similar). Soon after, a TA will manually pull you off that staging room into their office hours to help you.

Piazza (Online Discussion Group): These are discussion sections under the topic channels of "Homeworks, Labs, Quizzes, and Exams" where TAs and Instructor will answer general questions regarding specific homework, quiz, algorithm intuition, etc., to larger groups of attendees.
