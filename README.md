Course Description
Catalog Description:  This course is designed to equip you with the fundamental tools and techniques essential for solving complex computational problems. Throughout the course, we will explore a wide array of data structures—such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables—and learn how to effectively implement and use them in Python. We will also delve into essential algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimizing solutions to various problems. This course emphasizes not just learning the theory but applying it through hands-on coding exercises and problem-solving sessions that simulate real-world challenges. By the end of the course, you will be well-prepared to tackle advanced topics in data science, approach complex problems with confidence, and apply these skills in your professional or academic pursuits.

The topics covered in this course include the following, presented in the approximate order in which they will be taught.

- Computational Complexity
- Basic Data Structures and Algorithms
- Hash Tables
- Trees and Graphs
- Balanced Trees
- Advanced Algorithms I
- Advanced Algorithms II
- Classic CS Problems and Reductions
- Time Complexity Hierarchy
- Introduction to Databases
